# Contributing to Web Icons

Looking to contribute something to Web Icons? **Here's how you can help.**



## Requesting new icons

New icons mostly start as requests by the [Web Icons community on GitHub](../../issues). Want to request a new icon? Here are some things to keep in mind:

1. Please be nice. Web Icons is a happy place.
2. Please [search](../../search?type=Issues) to see if your icon request already exists. If a request is found, please +1 that one.
3. Please make requests for single icons, unless you are requesting a couple of strictly related icons (e.g., thumbs-up/thumbs-down).
4. Please and thank you if you include the following:
  - Title your [new issue](../../issues/new?title=Icon%20Request:) `Icon request: web-name` (e.g., `Icon request: google`).
  - Include the brand site url?
  - Attach a single color image or two that represent the idea you're going for.


## Reporting issues

We only accept issues that are icon requests, bug reports, or feature requests. Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within the Web Icons core. Please read the following guidelines to ensure you are the paragon of bug reporting.

1. **Search for existing issues.** We get a lot of duplicate issues, and you'd help us out a lot by first checking if someone else has reported the same issue. Moreover, the issue may have already been resolved with a fix available.
2. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case.** Be sure the problem exists in Web Icons's code with a [reduced test case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) that should be included in each bug report.
3. **Include a live example.** Make use of jsFiddle, jsBin, or Codepen to share your isolated test cases.
4. **Share as much information as possible.** Include operating system and version, browser and version, version of Web Icons, etc. where appropriate. Also include steps to reproduce the bug.
